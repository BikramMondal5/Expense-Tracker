### Example Conversations:

**User**: "How much did I spend on food this month?"  
**Gemini AI**: "Hi! Let me check your food expenses for the last 30 days... üçΩÔ∏è

Based on your transaction data, you've spent ‚Çπ8,450 on food across 15 transactions. That's about ‚Çπ563 per day on average.

Breaking it down:
‚Ä¢ Restaurants: ‚Çπ5,200 (62%)
‚Ä¢ Groceries: ‚Çπ3,250 (38%)

This accounts for 42% of your monthly budget. I'd recommend:
1. Try meal prepping 2-3 days a week to reduce restaurant visits
2. Shop with a grocery list to avoid impulse purchases
3. Potential savings: ‚Çπ2,000-2,500/month

Keep tracking! You're doing great! üí™"

**User**: "What should I focus on to save money?"  
**Gemini AI**: "Great question! After analyzing your spending patterns, here are my top 3 recommendations: üí°

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Entertainment (28% of budget)** - You're spending ‚Çπ2,800/month here
   ‚Üí Consider free events, library, or rotate subscriptions
   ‚Üí Potential savings: ‚Çπ800-1,000/month

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Transport (22% of budget)** - ‚Çπ2,200/month on commute
   ‚Üí Try carpooling 2-3 days/week
   ‚Üí Monthly pass might be cheaper than daily tickets
   ‚Üí Potential savings: ‚Çπ400-600/month

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Impulse purchases** - I noticed 8 small purchases under ‚Çπ200
   ‚Üí Implement the 24-hour rule before buying
   ‚Üí Could save: ‚Çπ300-400/month

Total potential savings: ‚Çπ1,500-2,000/month! üéâ
