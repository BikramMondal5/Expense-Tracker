# Google Gemini AI Integration Guide

## Overview
The Summary feature now uses **Google Gemini AI** to provide intelligent, real-time responses about your expenses. The AI analyzes your actual transaction data and provides personalized financial insights.

## How It Works

### 1. User Authentication & Data Isolation
- When a user signs in (e.g., `abc@gmail.com`), their email is stored in `auth_manager.current_user`
- Only transactions for the logged-in user are fetched from `users.json`
- The AI receives ONLY the current user's data, ensuring privacy

### 2. Data Flow
```
User Login (abc@gmail.com)
    ↓
auth_manager.current_user = "abc@gmail.com"
    ↓
Fetch user data: users["abc@gmail.com"]
    ↓
Extract expenses from that user's record
    ↓
Format expense data for AI
    ↓
Send to Google Gemini API
    ↓
Receive AI-generated response
    ↓
Display to user
```

### 3. Data Preparation
The system automatically prepares comprehensive expense data including:
- **Overall Statistics**: Total transactions, total spent, weekly/monthly totals
- **Category Breakdown**: Spending by category with percentages
- **Account Breakdown**: Spending by payment method (Cash, Bank, Credit Card)
- **Time-based Analysis**: Last 7 days and last 30 days summaries
- **Recent Transactions**: Last 5 transactions with details
- **Budget Status**: Comparison with monthly budget (if set)

## API Configuration

### API Key Storage
The Gemini API key is stored in `gemini_config.py`:
```python
GEMINI_API_KEY = "AIzaSyCAk4mkNVUtb3Fqi1SoU_a4y6r7_sWhxxs"
```

### Security Notes
⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: 
- Never commit `gemini_config.py` to public repositories
- Add it to `.gitignore`
- For production, use environment variables instead

## Example Interactions

### User Asks: "Summarize my expenses from the last week"

**What the AI receives:**
```
User: abc@gmail.com
Currency: INR (₹)
Monthly Budget: ₹10,000

Transaction Data Summary:
- Total Transactions: 45
- Total Spent (All Time): ₹125,450.00
- Last 7 Days: ₹3,200.00 (8 transactions)
- Last 30 Days: ₹18,500.00 (22 transactions)

Category Breakdown:
- FUEL: ₹2,500.00 (40.0%)
- UTILITIES: ₹5,077.00 (25.0%)
- ENTERTAINMENT: ₹4,105.00 (20.0%)
...
```

**AI Response:**
```
📊 Your Weekly Spending Summary

Hey! Let me break down your expenses from the last 7 days:

💰 Total Spent: ₹3,200.00 (8 transactions)
📈 Daily Average: ₹457.14

🏆 Top Spending Categories:
• FUEL: ₹2,500.00 (78%)

✅ Budget Status:
You're doing great! That's only ₹200 over your weekly target of ₹3,000 
(based on your ₹10,000 monthly budget).

💡 Quick Tip: Your fuel expenses seem high this week. Consider carpooling 
or using public transport when possible to reduce this category!

## Technical Implementation

### Key Functions

#### `_generate_ai_response(user_message)`
Main function that:
1. Gets current user's email from `auth_manager.current_user`
2. Fetches ONLY that user's data from `users.json`
3. Prepares expense summary
4. Sends to Gemini API
5. Returns AI-generated response

#### `_prepare_expense_data_for_ai(expenses, ...)`
Formats transaction data into a comprehensive summary:
- Calculates statistics
- Groups by category and account
- Filters by time period
- Formats for AI consumption

#### `_update_last_ai_message(new_message)`
Updates chat display with AI response:
- Removes "Thinking..." indicator
- Displays actual AI response
- Maintains chat history

### Error Handling
```python
try:
    response = gemini_api.generate(...)
except Exception as e:
    return "⚠️ Connection error. Please check internet and try again."
```

## Privacy & Security

### Data Privacy ✅
- **User Isolation**: Each user only sees their own data
- **No Data Sharing**: Data is sent to Gemini API only during active chat
- **Session-Based**: User email stored temporarily during login session
- **Local First**: Data primarily stored locally in `users.json`

### What Gets Sent to Gemini:
- User's name and email (for context)
- Currency and budget settings
- Transaction list (amounts, categories, dates)
- User's question

### What Does NOT Get Sent:
- Password (never sent anywhere)
- Other users' data
- Banking credentials
- Personal identification beyond email

## Installation

### Requirements
```bash
pip install google-generativeai>=0.3.0
```

Already added to `requirements.txt`:
```
google-generativeai>=0.3.0
```

### Setup Steps
1. ✅ Install package: `pip install google-generativeai`
2. ✅ Create `gemini_config.py` with API key
3. ✅ Import in `summary_screen.py`
4. ✅ Initialize Gemini model
5. ✅ Test with sample questions

## Testing

### Test Scenarios

1. **New User (No Expenses)**
   - Expected: Welcome message, suggestions to start tracking

2. **User with Few Expenses**
   - Expected: Basic summary, encouragement to add more data

3. **User with Rich Data**
   - Expected: Detailed analysis, specific recommendations

4. **Different Users**
   - User A (abc@gmail.com) should ONLY see their data
   - User B (xyz@gmail.com) should ONLY see their data
   - No cross-contamination

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Could not resolve import"
**Solution**: Restart VS Code or Python extension after installing package

### Issue: API Error
**Solution**: 
- Check internet connection
- Verify API key is correct
- Check Gemini API quota/limits

### Issue: Wrong user data shown
**Solution**:
- Verify `auth_manager.current_user` is set correctly
- Check login flow stores email properly
- Ensure `get_current_user_data()` returns correct user

### Issue: Generic responses
**Solution**:
- Check if expense data is being prepared correctly
- Verify user has transactions in `users.json`
- Check date format in transactions

## Cost Considerations

### Google Gemini API Pricing
- Gemini Pro: Free tier available
- Rate limits apply
- Monitor usage in Google Cloud Console

### Optimization
- Responses are concise (150-300 words)
- Only sends necessary data
- Caches don't store conversation history

## Future Enhancements

1. **Conversation Memory**: Remember context across messages
2. **Export Insights**: Save AI recommendations as PDF
3. **Scheduled Reports**: Automated weekly/monthly summaries
4. **Voice Input**: Ask questions via voice
5. **Multi-language**: Responses in user's language
6. **Budget Predictions**: AI forecasts future spending
7. **Goal Tracking**: AI helps set and monitor financial goals

## Code Example

### How User Data is Isolated
```python
def _generate_ai_response(self, user_message):
    # Get ONLY the logged-in user's email
    current_user_email = self.auth_manager.current_user
    # Example: "abc@gmail.com"
    
    # Fetch ONLY this user's data
    user_data = self.auth_manager.get_current_user_data()
    # Returns: users["abc@gmail.com"] from users.json
    
    # Extract ONLY this user's expenses
    expenses = user_data.get("expenses", [])
    # These are ONLY abc@gmail.com's transactions
    
    # AI receives ONLY this user's data
    response = gemini_api.generate(expenses)
    
    return response
```

- ✅ Real-time intelligent responses
